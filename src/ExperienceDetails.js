        I did my 6-month internship at GTN Tech As a member of Team ESS, I contributed to the design and development of the Enterprise Subscription Services Solution using SingleSPA, ReactJS, GraphQL, Prisma, NodeJS, Postgres, and AWS Lambda. 
        Through this experience, I became familiar with micro frontend and microservice architecture. I worked on projects Exchange Subscription, which helped clients understand necessary agreements and subscription history, and Reporting Dynamics, which automated report generation and handling exceptions. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work as a release manager in a sprint, ensuring smooth and timely production releases. I also participated in GTN Interns' Day, GTN Awrudu, and dinner outings.`,
